# DormanPrins-method
 Dormand–Prince (RKDP) method or DOPRI method, is an explicit method for solving ordinary differential equations

In numerical analysis, the Dormand–Prince (RKDP) method or DOPRI method, is an explicit method for solving ordinary differential equations (Dormand & Prince 1980). The method is a member of the Runge–Kutta family of ODE solvers. More specifically, it uses six function evaluations to calculate fourth- and fifth-order accurate solutions. The difference between these solutions is then taken to be the error of the (fourth-order) solution. This error estimate is very convenient for adaptive stepsize integration algorithms. Other similar integration methods are Fehlberg (RKF) and Cash–Karp (RKCK).
